        "**Descriptive Statistics** \n",
        " - it summaries a dataset, which helps in gaining insights, and making inferences about a dataset.\n",
        " - In general, we compute statistical measures of one or more samples, related to a population, and draw conclusions about the population.\n",
        " - Descriptive Statistics involves estimating centrality measures and measures of dispersion.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Centrality Measures**\n",
        " - It determine the center of a dataset.\n",
        " - The three major centrality measures are: mean, median, and mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mean**\n",
        " - it is the sum of all values divided by a total number of values, of a data set.\n",
        " - mean function of numpy is used to compute mean of an array of numbers\n",
        "\n",
        "**Median**\n",
        " - it is the value that separates the given data set into two halves.\n",
        " - median function of numpy library can be used to compute median of a data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Mode**\n",
        " - it is the value that appears most often in a dataset is called the mode value.\n",
        " - mode function of scipy.stats module can be used for computing mode of a given data set.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Measures of Dispersion**\n",
        " - it provides insights on the spread of given dataset.\n",
        " - Major measures of dispersion are: range, percentile, inter-quartile range, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**Range**\n",
        " - it is the difference between maximum and minimum values of the dataset.\n",

        "**Percentile**\n",
        " - it refers to a value, below which lies given the percentage of data points.\n",
        "\n",
        " - E.g., 45th percentile refers to a value below which 45% of data points are found.\n",
        " - percentile function of numpy can be used to compute a single or multiple percentiles.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Quartiles**\n",
        " - Three Quartiles namely, Q1 Q2 and Q3, split the entire dataset into four equal parts.\n",
        " - Each part contains 25% of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Inter Quartile Range (IQR)**\n",
        " - it refers to difference between third quartile (Q3) and first quartile (Q1).\n",
        " - iqr method from scipy.stats can be used for calculating it.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Variance**\n",
        " - it is defined as the average of squared differences, of each data point from dataset's mean.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Standard Deviation**\n",
        " - it is square root of variance.\n",
        " - var and std functions of numpy can be used for computing variance and standard deviation respectively.\n",
        " - By default, the functions assume that the dataset represents entire population.\n",
        "-  To represent a sample, derived from a population, ddof parameter(delta degree of freedom is set to 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Skewness**\n",
        "- it determines whether the majority of data points are present on one side of the distribution.\n",
        " - A positive value represents right skewed distribution; a negative value represents left skewed one, zero represent unskewed distribution.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Kurtosis**\n",
        " - Kurtosis indicates how much of data is concentrated around mean or shape of the probability distribution.\n",
        " - It can be estimated using kurtosis function of scipy.stats module.\n",
        " - By default, it uses Fisherâ€™s definition. This can be changed to Pearson by setting fisher parameter to False."
